### Instructions
1. First sign up for github account.
- Instructions can be found here [https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)
- I reccomend the free plan and choosing a username that is either your real name or a name you use consistently on social media, so people can find you.

2. Fill out this survey for our workshop [https://goo.gl/forms/yQl8W0CpY9lFaYao2](https://goo.gl/forms/yQl8W0CpY9lFaYao2). Don't spend too much time on it, but it will be helpful if you input something for each question. Your answers will be our first dataset for the workshop.
